    <h1>2020 United States Senate special election in Arizona</h1>
    <p>After John McCain's death, Governor Doug Ducey appointed former U.S. Senator Jon Kyl, but he resigned. After that, Ducey decided to appoint Martha McSally, who had run (and lost all of her bids) for Senate many times. As a result, a special election was forced.</p>
    <p>Do you want to run as <a style="color:blue;"href="kelly.html">Mark Kelly</a> or <a style="color:red;"href="martha.html">Martha McSally</a>?</p>
